Part I: Model
	What are we modeling?
		Define Energy Profile
			- Energy consumption by source by killowatt
				- as a function of population demographics
			- Energy production by source by killowatt (I'm still confused)
			- Amount spent per killowatt
			- Usage by sector
			- Price/accessibility
			- Reliablity
		Model how it has evolved from 1960 to 2009
			Predict some data in terms of causal variables
			Along with time, money, GDP, etc.
		Determine why each state's energy profile is the way it is
		Order the states
		Predict energy profile in 2025, 2050
		Do this by identifying causal variables
		And making a model to predict causal variables in 2025, 2050
Part II: Goals
	Make targets for renewable energy
	Determine three specific actions for achieving this goal
	
Part III: Letter
	Write about state of 2009 energy profile
	and predictions for 2025, 2050
	and recommendations for policy change/specific actions
